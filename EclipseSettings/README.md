# Eclipse Settings
This folder contains preference files for the ATL editor for various profiles. You can install these preference files in your workspace by copying the preference file of choice to `<WORKSPACE_ROOT>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/` directory.

An Ant `build.xml` file, with corresponding launch configurations in the `launch` directory, has been provided to make copying these preference files to the right directory easier.
